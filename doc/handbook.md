# Introduction
This document contains development notes about the `oauth2c` library.

# Versioning
The following `oauth2c` versions are available:
- `0.y.z` unstable versions.
- `x.y.z` stable versions: `oauth2c` will maintain reasonable backward
  compatibility, deprecating features before removing them.
- Experimental untagged versions.

Developers who use unstable or experimental versions are responsible for
updating their application when `oauth2c` is modified. Note that unstable
versions can be modified without backward compatibility at any time.
